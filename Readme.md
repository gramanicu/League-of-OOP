## Game overview

After the game driver loads the data into it's specific containers, the "game" is started. Each round, the player will try to move, choose a strategy, the status effect (if he has one) will apply, and then fights can start. If a fight is possible, both players will use their abilities at the same time.

One specific exception is the wizard, who will actively use only 1 ability, as the second is a passive. For every other ability he will get hit by (in other words, after the enemy hits him with both abilities), he will use `Deflect`.

After both heroes have used their abilities (and apply their specific status effects), their status will be checked: if only 1 of them died, the other will get xp based on the following formula `XP_Winner = XP_Winner + max(0, 200 - (Level_winner - Level_loser) * 40)` and will level up if he can do so. On level up, his `max_hp` will increase and his `hp` will be restored to maximum.

Also, at the end of each round, angels can spawn that can buff or debuff heroes. Some can even revive heroes, others can kill them.

The game is "overlooked" by the Great Wizard, a class that tracks events in the game (kills, angels, round starts, etc.).
